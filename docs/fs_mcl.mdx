title: Main Control Loop
sidebar_label: MCL
---

The **Main Control Loop (MCL)**, run by the **Supervisor** is the core of our Flight Software, controlling the **Read, Control, Actuate (RCA)** cycle. 
All data in FS in stored in a dictionary-type object called the **Registry**. Any actions that need to happen are noted in a very similiar object called the **Flag**. 

## [Supervisor.hpp](https://github.com/ProjectCaelus/cpp-flight-software/blob/master/include/flight/modules/mcl/Supervisor.hpp) and [Supervisor.cpp](https://github.com/ProjectCaelus/cpp-flight-software/blob/master/src/modules/mcl/Supervisor.cpp)

In the FS code hierarchy, Supervisor is at the top; it's responsible for starting and running the whole show. 

| ```Supervisor()```| 
| :----------- | 
| Deafult constructor. |


| Returns     | Method | Description | 
| :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | 
| ```void```  | ```initalize()``` | Reads in data from the specific ```config.json```. Intializes all the Control Tasks and Tasks found in the config file. | 
| ```void```  | ```read()```      | Calls the ```read()``` method of each Task. | 
| ```void```  | ```control()```   | Calls the ```control()``` method of each Control Task. | 
| ```void```  | ```actuate()```   | Calls the ```actuate()``` method of each Task.  | 
| ```void```  | ```run()```       | This is the main RCA loop. In an endless loop, Supervisor calls the ```read()```, ```contol()```, and ```actuate()``` methods.  | 


## [Registry.hpp](https://github.com/ProjectCaelus/cpp-flight-software/blob/master/include/flight/modules/mcl/Registry.hpp) and [Registry.cpp](https://github.com/ProjectCaelus/cpp-flight-software/blob/master/src/modules/mcl/Registry.cpp)

This Registry is a global registry - that means it's avaliable in any file, without imports or intializations, as it is passed to a class upon creation.
The Registry stores all sensor data, valve data, incoming telemetry packets, the stage of the rocket, and the mode of the rocket.

| ```Registry()```| 
| :-----------    | 
| Declares ```valves```, which given type and location information as strings, returns the associated ```RegistryValveInfo```. Declares ```sensors```, which given type and location information as strings, returns the associated ```RegistrySensorInfo```. Declares the priority queue of incoming telemetry logs. Also declares  some telemtry, stage, and abort variables. |

| Struct                    | Description  | 
| :----------               | :----------- | 
| ```RegistrySensorInfo```  | ```measured_value``` <br />  ```normalized_value``` <br /> ```SensorStatus``` | 
| ```RegistryValveInfo```   | ```SolenoidState```: default close. <br />  ```ActuationType```: default none. <br /> ```ValvePriority```: default none. | 

| Returns     | Method | Description | 
| :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | 
| ```void```  | ```initalize()``` | Initalizes sensors and valves according to _config.json_, as well as some default telemetry, stage, and abort variables. |
| ```bool```  | ```sensor_exists(string type, string location)``` | Returns true is the specified sensor is present in _config.json_ and has been initalized. |
| ```bool```  | ```valve_exists(string type, string location)```  | Returns true is the specified valve  is present in _config.json_ and has been initalized. |


## [Flag.hpp](https://github.com/ProjectCaelus/cpp-flight-software/blob/master/include/flight/modules/mcl/Flag.hpp) and [Flag.cpp](https://github.com/ProjectCaelus/cpp-flight-software/blob/master/src/modules/mcl/Flag.cpp)

The Flag is a global variable. It is initialized only once (by Supervisor) and is avaliable in any file, without imports or intializations, as it is passed to a class upon creation.
The Flag stores all pending actions, such as sensor calibration commands, valve actuation commands, outgoing telemetry packets, and abort commands.

| ```Flag()```| 
| :----------- | 
| Declares ```valves```, which given type and location information as strings, returns the associated ```FlagValveInfo```. Defines priority queues for outgoing and incoming logs. Notes the time of initalization. |

| Struct               | Description | 
| :----------          | :----------- | 
| ```FlagValveInfo```  | ```SolenoidState```: default close. <br />  ```ActuationType```: default none. <br /> ```ValvePriority```: default none. | 

| Returns     | Method | Description | 
| :---------- | :-------- | :----------- | 
| ```void```  | ```enqueue(Log log, LogPriority LogPriority)``` | Add the specified log into a new packet, then enqueues the packet. | 
| ```void```  | ```read(string header, json message)```         | Creates a log with the given information, then calls ```enqueue()``` with the log and an info-level priority. | 
| ```void```  | ```log_debug(string header, json message)```    |  Creates a log with the given information, then calls ```enqueue()``` with the log and a debug-level priority. | 
| ```void```  | ```log_warning(string header, json message)```  |   Creates a log with the given information, then calls ```enqueue()``` with the log and a warning-level priority.  | 
| ```void```  | ```log_critical(string header, json message)``` | Creates a log with the given information, then calls ```enqueue()``` with the log and a critical-level priority.  | 


## [Config.hpp](https://github.com/ProjectCaelus/cpp-flight-software/blob/master/include/flight/modules/mcl/Config.hpp) and [Config.cpp](https://github.com/ProjectCaelus/cpp-flight-software/blob/master/src/modules/mcl/Config.cpp)

The ```config.json``` file, short for configuration, is where we input any variables that might change, like the number of valves, the types of sensors, and the Ground Station IP address.
The ```Config.cpp``` and ```Config.hpp``` files help us process and store this information. The ```Config``` object created, called ```global_config```, is only initialized once, and is accessible from any file. 

| ```Config(json json)```| 
| :----------- | 
| From the json object, initalizes and stores all telemetry, sensor, valve, stage, timer, task, and control task information. |

| Struct      | Description | 
| :---------- | :----------- | 
| ```ConfigBoundary```  | ```lower``` <br />  ```upper``` <br /> Stores the minimum and maximum allowable sensor readings. | 
| ```ConfigState```  | ```safe``` <br />  ```warn``` <br /> Stores the whether the sensor readings have gone beyond the allowable boundaries. | 
| ```ConfigSensorInfo```  | ```safe``` <br />  ```warn``` <br /> Stores the whether the sensor readings have gone beyond the allowable boundaries. | 
| ```ConfigValveInfo```  | ```kalman_args```, including ```doubles``` ```process_variance```, ```measurement_variance``` and ```kalman_value```. <br />  ```boundaries```, including ```ConfigStage``` ```waiting```, ```pressurization```, ```autosequence``` and ```postburn```. <br />  | 

| Returns     | Method | Description | 
| :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | 
| ```void```  | ```to_json(json j, const ConfigBoundary boundary)```        | Transfers the data in ```boundary``` to the json object ```j```.  | 
| ```void```  | ```from_json(json j, const ConfigBoundary boundary)```      | Transfers the data in the json object ```j``` to ```boundary```. | 
| ```void```  | ```to_json(json j, const ConfigSensorInfo sensor_info)```   | Transfers the sensor data in ```boundary``` to the json object ```j```. | 
| ```void```  | ```from_json(const json j, ConfigSensorInfo sensor_info)``` | Transfers the sensor data in the json object ```j``` to ```boundary```.  | 
| ```void```  | ```to_json(json j, const ConfigValveInfo valve_info)```     | Transfers the valve data in ```boundary``` to the json object ```j```. | 
| ```void```  | ```from_json(const json j, ConfigValveInfo valve_info)```   | Transfers the valve data in the json object ```j``` to ```boundary```.  |
