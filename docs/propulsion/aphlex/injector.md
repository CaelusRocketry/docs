title: Aphlex 1C Engine - Injector
sidebar_label: Injector
---

### Overview
The third step in designing the Aphlex 1C engine is the injector portion, which takes in key input parameters including manufacturing constraints and key defining characteristics, as well as the propellant mass flow rates and properties. The code characterizes a like-on-like doublet impinging injector, outlining the number of oxidizer and fuel orifices, as well as their respective diameters, distances, and more. These outputs can be used to design and manufacture the injector.
